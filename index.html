                <p>Extension-7 is our first room in Bangabandhu Hall, But it was situated far from the main hall. We
                    started
                    the journey with the greatest moderator <span class="orange">Mr Tashriful huda</span> , Noobshit
                    PUBG
                    player Hussain Foysal, son with his mother in campus Sadat pranto, Medical admission candidate BC
                    Anirban Bose and
                    Jubayer the Suit Boy From Tangail. There Was a boy from Norsingdi which was alloted in the room, but
                    we
                    kicked him from the room and I captured his bed. From then ZR Nibir becomes the new heda in the
                    Room.
                    We got ragged from the south hall extension -6, and some times in our main
                    hall. The time was difficult but I think that was the golden time of our internal university life.
